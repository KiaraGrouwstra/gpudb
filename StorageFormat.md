## Notice ##
We are making some changes to the format. The doc will be updated after we finish.

## Introduction ##

The data are stored in column-stored format in disk. Each attribute of the table is stored as an independent file in the disk, the name of which is the table name (the table name defined in the schema file)+ the index of the attribute in the table. For example, Table A has three attributes. Then the three attributes will be stored in three independent files: A0, A1 and A2. Since the codes to access the files are automatically generated by the translator, the files should be correctly named based on the aforementioned rule.

Each attribute file has a column header which denotes the format of the column(whether it is compressed and how it is compressed), followed by the binary representation of the data.

All the columns, compressed and uncompressed, have the same header structure:<br>
<pre><code><br>
struct columnHeader{<br>
        long tupleNum;<br>
        int format;<br>
};<br>
<br>
</code></pre>

For uncompressed columns, the colomnHeader is followed by the binary representation of the real data.<br>
<br>
For compressed data, the columnHeader is followed by a compressionHeader which indicates the data compression type and contains information to uncompress the data. The structure of compressionHeader depends on the compression type.
